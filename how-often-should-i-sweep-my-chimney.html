							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>How often should i sweep my chimney</strong>. 
					
											The National Fire Protection Association Standard 211 says Chimneys fireplaces and vents shall be inspected at least once a year for soundness freedom from deposits and correct clearances. 
											Do potato skins help clean chimneys. 
											Every chimney will have a recommended frequency for sweeping. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Cleaning maintenance and repairs shall be done if necessary So even if you dont use your chimney a whole lot birds squirrels raccoons and other critters may have been using your chimney. 
											Ensuring your safety is vital so in order to have a clean and safe flue chimney you must first ensure that you arent leaving yourself open to any avoidable danger by going into the task of sweeping your own chimney without guidance. 
											Before attempting to clean. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This is a common concern. 
											However if you have a wood burner or you use bituminous coal the frequency will be four times as high. 
											Due to the health and safety risks that come from leaving a chimney unattended to chimney inspections should be scheduled once a year at the minimum. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											When a fire has not been used for a long time. 
											Both the NFPA and Spisto recommend getting your chimney cleaned and inspected once a year by a qualified professional. 
											The simple answer is. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The best times to have your chimney swept are just before the start of the heating season and after your stove has not been used over a prolonged period. 
											Sweeping your own chimney is obviously entirely different from cleaning chimneys. 
											A chimney sweep will clean and remove built-up creosote debris and soot from your chimney liner. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Many people choose to get their chimney swept at the end of summer so that it is ready for the colder temperatures ahead. 
											How often should I have my chimney swept. 
											As an APICS member I encourage having your chimney swept at least twice a year 3 months within use when burning wood or bituminous house coal and at least once a year when burning smokeless fuels.

											How often should I get my chimney cleaned. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											How often you need to get your chimney swept will vary based on how often you use your chimney. 
											There is no issue with sweeping too often so if you are concerned or dont know sweep it. 
											If you regularly burn wood or coal in your fireplace you should sweep your chimney every season. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This a tougher question than it sounds. 
											It is vital to remove any. 
											If you rely on either an oil or gas fire then once a year is perfectly adequate.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											How often should my chimney be swept. 
											How often should the chimney be cleaned. 
											Chimney sweep costs will vary depending on the condition of the chimney ease of access and how many chimneys need to be swept. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											It is important to have your chimney cleaned because it will keep your chimney performing properly and keep your family safe and healthy. 
											IVE JUST MOVED INTO A HOUSE WITH A FIRE PLACE SHOULD I GET IT CHECKED. 
											Yes you should definitely have it checked and swept. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											How often you need to clean your chimneys really depends on the type of chimney you have the design and how often it is used. 
											Generally speaking when you see glaze its time to call a chimney sweep. 
											If we observe a minimum of ⅛-inch deposit of soot in the chimney we will recommend that it be swept. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The National Fire Prevention Association NFPA every flue should be inspected once a year for proper functionality and to ensure it is free from defect.

											HOW OFTEN SHOULD I GET MY CHIMNEY SWEPT. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											It depends on the type of fuel used for your indoor fire but chimneys should be cleaned regularly to deter risks of carbon monoxide poisoning or uncontrolled fires in the chimney. 
											If you have just moved in and you dont know when the previous owners last swept it or you have simply forgotten. 
											In reality the frequency with which you should have your chimney swept depends on the type of fire you have. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											You should have your chimney swept at least once a year as a bare minimum. 
											This ensures your chimney is kept as clean as possible and prevents buildup that will become harder to remove if you leave it. 
											HETAS encourage having your chimney swept at least twice a year when burning wood or bituminous house coal and at least once a year when burning smokeless fuels. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											When you dont know when it was last swept. 
											At the very least you should get your chimney swept once a year.

											If sweeping twice a year the second time should be after the peak of. 
											These are occasions when you should sweep your chimney.
